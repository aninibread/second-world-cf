# Background & Intro
I love baking, especially, making Asian deserts to share with my family & friends. Baking at University can be difficult, as I don't often have all the right equipment and ingredients to make anything too complex. So here is a simple recipe for a really yummy and unique brownie that you can make within 1 hour.

## Taste Profile
This desert typically tastes like a chewy mochi cake. For those not familiar with mochi, the texture is like a floury and stretchy gummy. The flavor is like rice with a hint of natural sweetness. By adding the matcha powder, the flavor is enhanced with a dry but sophisticatedly bitter tea taste. 

In this recipe, there is an addition of butter. I personally experimented with the addition of butter and have found that it's able to add a stronger milk flavour, and make the consistency more cake-like, which I preferred more. But it is an optional ingredient, and without butter, the desert is still very tasty and resembles more of the typical mochi desert.

# All Ingredients

What I love about this recipe is that you don't have to be too precise. Feel free to slightly adjust sugar and matcha levels based on your taste.

| Ingredients                         | Quantity    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| glutinous rice flour                | 1.5 cup     |
| cane sugar                          | 1/3 cup     |
| unsalted butter *melted* (optional) | 5 tbsp      |
| baking powder                       | 1 tsp       |
| large egg                           | 1 egg       |
| matcha powder                       | 2 tbsp      |
| canned coconut milk                 | 1 cup       |
| salt                                | 1 pinch     |
| chocolate chip                      | 1/2 cup     |

Here are some of the brands I'd recommend for the different type of ingredients. For glutinous rice flour you can either use the Thai brand shown below, or Mochiko. Having tried both, I actually prefer the Thai brand, but regardless, the difference isn't big.

An additional note is that you can use non-canned coconut milk but if you want a more intense coconut taste then the canned ones would be better. Other types of milk works too.

For matcha powder, definitely try to find a good premium brand. A good matcha can make a huuugge difference. Same with good chocolate.
