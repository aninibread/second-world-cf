# Intro
Seattle, April 9th, birthday. That was the day it all began... my Woobles crochet addiction. 

As a gesture of generosity, one of my friends decided to gift me a Woobles crocheting kit, a simple penguin. You may be thinking, I know what crochet is but what's a <a href="https://thewoobles.com/en-ca" target="_blank">Wooble</a>. Well it's a brand that makes the cutest, most loveable amigurumi patterns and their kits come with all the necessary ingredients to build the plushy. Since that day, I couldn't put the crochet hooks down.

In the beginning I would crochet for 6-8 hours a day, and eventually I was able to control it down to 1-2 hours before school started. And as expected my room became very crowded with all sorts of crochet animals.

## The Gift that Keeps on Giving
To me what I enjoy about crocheting is more about the process. Being able to focus on every stroke, creating every knot, gave me a sense of calmness and peace. Although it was nice to see the final pieces of adorable creations staring back at me, I wasn't particularly attached to them. It reminded me of Buddhist Mandalas, where the art rests in the process of creation rather than the result.

And so the final Woobles naturally served as good gifts that I can send to my friends and family as a sign of my love to them. üíù

*Here is an account of where my Woobles are now.*

# My Crochets
## Pierre & Petit Pierre

Pierre the Penguin as you already know is my first ever Wooble. By the end of completing the kit, I had about 1/3 of the original yarn left, and so of course, I decided to make a petit pierre.

By the end of this project, I realized that the Woobles also sold accessories for the animals. I found this cute pair of bunny ears on their website and crocheted it for Pierre. With the remainder of the bunny ear yarn, I made a mini version for Petit Pierre.

This father son duo naturally became the perfect gift for my mom. üë©‚Äçüëß

## Fred Dino & Sebastian Lion

The next set of Woobles were created with intension. At the time I was interning in-person in Seattle, so I decided to make a disco Dino, Fred, and king of the jungle Lion, Sebastian, for my two managers for their mentorship and support through out my internship.

## Bj√∏rn Narwhal

The narwhal, Bj√∏rn, I made for one of my mom's friends who is like family to me. I wanted to gift her something to showed strength and freedom which the narwhal was perfect for.

## Henri Frog Prince

Henri the Frog I got with the prince accessories, which made him even valiant. I decided to gift this to one of my friends who continuously shows bravery, courage, and kindness.

## Strawberry Axolotl & Gertrude Lama & Toast Shiba

The last three plushies that I have made are Strawberry the Axolotl, Gertrude the Lama, and Toast the Shiba, which currently are still with me. They keep me company in my workstation at home.
